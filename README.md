===========

iDynTree is a library of robots dynamics algorithms for control, estimation and simulation. It is specifically designed for free-floating robots, but it is possible to use it also  with fixed-base robots.

The **major characteristic features** of iDynTree are:
* It is written in **C++**, with **Python** and **MATLAB** bindings.
* It uses an  **undirected graph data structure** (`iDynTree::Model`) that is used to represent robots, to easily change the **base link** that you are using for your kinematics and dynamics computations without the need to reload your model or change your joint or link serializations. This is done as iDynTree was developed for floating-base robots such as humanoids, in which the most convenient choice of **base link** can change.
* It contains support for **reading and writing URDF files** from a `iDynTree::Model`, making it useful to write tools that modify robot models and saves them back to file. This is done as iDynTree was meant to develop **tools for identification of kinematics and dynamics parameters**.
* It defaults to use the **mixed representation** to represent link quantities (including the velocity and acceleration of the base link), but it can optionally use also **body (left-trivialized)** or **inertial (right-trivialized)** representation if requested. This is done because iDynTree was developed to satisfy the needs of **research in synthesis of floating-base whole-body controllers**. If you are not familiar with the different representation for 6D quantities, check  [Section 6 of "Multibody dynamics notation (version 2)"](
https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/139293126/A_Multibody_Dynamics_Notation_Revision_2_.pdf).
* It contains an implementation of the algorithm used in the iCub humanoid robot to **estimate the joint torques without the need of collocated joint torque sensors**, exploting the specific **undirected graph data structure** . This is done as this was one of the originally goal for the implementation of iDynTree. See the class [`iDynTree::ExtWrenchesAndJointTorquesEstimator`](https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/blob/master/src/estimation/include/iDynTree/ExtWrenchesAndJointTorquesEstimator.h) and [Chapter 6 of "Modelling, Estimation and Identification of Humanoid Robots Dynamics"](https://traversaro.github.io/traversaro-phd-thesis/traversaro-phd-thesis.pdf).

To avoid confusion, it is also useful to clarify what **iDynTree is not**:
* It is not the **fastest C++ library** for kinematics and dynamics multibody computations for robotics. It is not slow, but if have an application in which you need the absolute fastest library, check out [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio).
* It is not a **multibody simulator** library. It provides the building blocks that you could use to build a multibody simulator, but it is not a multibody simulator per se. If you need a simulator library in C++, check out [DART](https://dartsim.github.io/), [Simbody](https://github.com/simbody/simbody), [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/), [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) or the abstraction layer [`Gazebo Physics`](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-physics). If you need a simulator implemented in MATLAB/Simulink (built on iDynTree), check [`matlab-whole-body-simulator`](https://github.com/ami-iit/matlab-whole-body-simulator). If you need a simulator that is differentiable and runs on GPU, check [`jaxsim`](https://github.com/ami-iit/jaxsim) or [MuJoCo XLA (mjx)](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html).
* It does not provide algorithms in a form in which they can be used in [CasADi](http://casadi.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). For a Python library with an interface inspired by iDynTree that provides algorithms compatible with these frameworks, check [`adam`](https://github.com/ami-iit/adam) robotics library.

## Installation

### conda (recommended) 

You can easily install the C++ and Python library with via [`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org) using the following command
~~~
conda install -c conda-forge idyntree
~~~

If you need to install also the MATLAB bindings, you can install them with:
~~~
conda install -c conda-forge -c robotology idyntree-matlab-bindings
~~~

If you are not familiar with conda or conda-forge, you can read an introduction document in [conda-forge overview](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild/blob/master/doc/conda-forge.md#conda-forge-overview).

### robotology-superbuild (advanced)

If you are installing iDynTree for use as part of [iCub humanoid robot software installation](https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/sw_installation/), you may want to install iDynTree through the [robotology-superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild), an easy way to download, compile and install the robotology software on multiple operating systems, using the [CMake](https://www.cmake.org) build system and its extension [YCM](http://robotology.github.io/ycm). To get iDynTree when using the `robotology-superbuild`, please enable the `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS` CMake option of the superbuild. If you want to install also iDynTree Python or MATLAB bindings, remember to enable the `ROBOTOLOGY_USES_PYTHON` or `ROBOTOLOGY_USES_MATLAB` options. 

### Build from source (advanced)

If you want to build iDynTree directly from source, you can check the documentation in [`doc/build-from-source.md`](doc/build-from-source.md).

## Library Usage

### Usage in C++
Once the library is installed, you can link it in C++ programs using `CMake` with as little effort as writing the following line of code in your project's `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
find_package(iDynTree REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(<target> PRIVATE iDynTree::idyntree-high-level iDynTree::idyntree-estimation)
```

See [CMake's reference documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/) if you need more info on the [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) or [`target_link_libraries`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html) CMake commands.

### Usage in MATLAB
To make sure that iDynTree is available in MATLAB, try to run some simple code that uses it:
~~~
p = iDynTree.Position()
~~~

If this is not working, make sure that you are launching `matlab` after having activated the conda environment (if you installed iDynTree via conda) or after having sourced por executed the correct setup script (if you installed iDynTree via the robotology-superbuild).

## Tools Usage 

iDynTree also includes some command line tools to use some of the functionality of the library without writing any line of code. The available command line tools are listed in the following, and each tool also includes an online help that is tipically available by passing the `-h` flag.

### `idyntree-model-info`

Tool that reads a model from a file, and print some useful information as specified via the command line.

Example: Print the total mass of a given model
~~~
idyntree-model-info -m <location-of-the-model> --total-mass
~~~

### `idyntree-model-view`

Tool that reads a model from a file and visualize it using the `idyntree-visualizer` library

Example: Visualize a given model
~~~
idyntree-model-view -m <location-of-the-model>

### `idyntree-model-simplify-shapes`

Tool that reads a model from a file, and returns in output the same model, but with all 
solid shapes of the model (both collision and visual) substituted with a primitive shape 
that approximates in some way the original solid shape. At the moment, the only conversion 
type provided is to approximate each solid shape of the model with its axis aligned bounding box.

Example: Approximate a given model
~~~
idyntree-model-simplify-shapes -m <location-of-the-input-model> -o <desired-location-of-the-output-model>
