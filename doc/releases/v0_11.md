iDynTree 0.11 Release Notes
=========================

Important Changes
-----------------

### `core`
* Improve SpatialInertia documentation ( https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/435 ).

### `sensors`
* The `iDynTree/Sensors/SixAxisFTSensor.h` header has been deprecated in favor of the  `iDynTree/Sensors/SixAxisForceTorqueSensor.h`.

### `model_io`
* Added dependency on [Gnome libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org), see next bullet point.
* Added library `idyntree-modelio-xml` to parse generic XML files. Support for XSD validation (when parsing from file). This library requires [Gnome libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org).
* Rewritten URDF parser to use the new `idyntree-modelio-xml` library.
* Dropped required dependency on TinyXML1. If TinyXML is found in the system, it is possible to compile the old URDF parser that has been renamed into `idyntree-modelio-urdf-legacy`.
