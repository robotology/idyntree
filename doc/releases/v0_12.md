iDynTree 0.12 Release Notes
=========================

Summary
-------
* 

Important Changes
-----------------

#### `high-level`
* Added method to compute the inverse dynamics inertial parameters regressor in KinDynComputations ( https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/480 ).
KinDynComputations finally reached feature parity with respect to DynamicsComputations, that will finally be removed in one of the future iDynTree feature releases.

#### `inverse-kinematics`
* Added method to return the convex hull of the constraint on the projection of the center of mass (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/478).

#### `optimalcontrol`
* Added objects to deal with linear optimal control problems.
* Added ``OSQP`` interface via ``osqp-eigen``.
* Fixed bugs in ``MultipleShooting`` solver.
* Added few lines of documentation.

#### `visualization`
* Added visualization of vectors.
